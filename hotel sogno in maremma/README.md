# Hotel Sogno in Maremma

## Project Description

This website is designed to provide detailed information about the fictional Hotel Sogno in Maremma, located in the picturesque region of Tuscany, Italy. For this reason the original language is italian. Users can read about various services, explore the four type of rooms proposed and check booking availability. Room, number of people, dates and type of board can be selected and, depending on that, prices are automatically calculated through the site. 
The hotel represented doesn't exist, it's just a project website, every contact or location information is fictional for illustrative purposes only.
