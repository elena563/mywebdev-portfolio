# Save the Shark - Frontend Project

## Project Description

This website is designed for the fictional no profit organization Save the Shark, dedicated to the preservation of the sea and its inhabitants, with a particular attention for sharks. Users can read about the association, its mission, goals and story, explore the charity merchandising and join the community with a form. In the "discover" section, many species of shark are shortly descripted and represented, in order to inform about an animal that is often poorly known.
